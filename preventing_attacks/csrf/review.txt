Great job! You’ve hardened a web form using the csurf module to implement CSRF tokens. With the CSRF middleware functions configured at the router level, it is easy to harden forms on any page as long as the CSRF token is included in the view of the form.

Setting up the CSURF middleware in our code and specifying CSRF tokens be stored in cookies
Using CSURF to generate a CSRF token
Putting a hidden input of the CSRF token in the HTML form
Handling the case where the form input CSRF token doesn’t match the one generated by the server
